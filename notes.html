<h1>Notes</h1>
    
<p>
For our project, we used the Star Wars API to build parallel tables of people and starships. These tables link to each other, and sort by every category except for the rightmost column. Our CSS keeps the classic Star Wars theme, and we even include the audio of the Star Wars intro to reinforce this. We use multiple promises to retrieve our data, and link between each page with buttons. With these tables the user can sort by relevant categories to gain insight into the people and starships of the Star Wars universe.
